## Crepe Recipe

### Classic French Crepes

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1/2 cup water
- 2 tbsp melted butter
- 1/4 tsp salt

**Instructions:**
1. Whisk the flour and eggs together in a mixing bowl.
2. Gradually add the milk and water, stirring to combine.
3. Add the melted butter and salt, then beat until smooth.
4. Let the batter rest for 15 to 30 minutes at room temperature.
5. Heat a lightly buttered non-stick pan over medium-high heat.
6. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter into the pan, tilting and swirling to coat the surface evenly.
7. Cook for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light golden.
8. Flip and cook the other side for about 1 minute.
9. Serve with your choice of fillings — fresh fruit, Nutella, whipped cream, or savory options like ham and cheese.

Makes about 8 crepes.
